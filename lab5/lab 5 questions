1. The color information is coming from the DIFF field from the json file. In this line "color: getColorFor(data.properties.DIFF)" it shows calling upon the diff field in this line.
2. Top write in an intermediate lightblue tier with a break at 3, you would go to "function getColorFor(value) {
return value" and after the values you have added in you could add "value >= 3 ? '#67a9cf':" to get a light blue layer with a break at 3
3. The color elements of the map are easy to understand if you know what colors correspond to what political parties in the US. The timeline moves a bit too fast 
for the map to be analyzed. It may also be confusing that there is no legend to the map to show what colors correspond with what values.
4. Sacling radius by a direct value is bad for symbol mapping because it does not give the viewer the best analyzing experience because it would give a bunch of different sizes of radius instead of categories.
The resulting symbols would still be proportional because it is still loading in the radius properly.
